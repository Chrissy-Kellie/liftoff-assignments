## Submission Instructions

### Overview
As a mother of two school-aged children, I am often frusterated with the lack of communication surrounding my sons' bus schedules.  If, for example, one of their buses arrives late, my only notification for such is the actual experience of putting my kids on the bus... AFTER the scheduled pickup time.  For my project, I would like to develop an app to help resolve issues relating to tardy school buses.

### Features
This application will allow users to set up personal accounts by registering a username and password.  Upon logging in with the correct credentials, the user can track the bus using a map/navigation feature.  Users will also have the ability to opt-in to receive text notifications about route/schedule changes; including anticipated late arrival.

### Technologies
I plan to use a combination of Java, HTML, and SQL to develop the application

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn how to use/incorporate mapping/navigation.
